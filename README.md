# Sensordrop-Networks-internship-work
I worked Sensordrop Networks (http://www.sensordropsnetworks.com/) from 20th July,2020 to 20th Sept,2020 as an intern. During this time I worked with Heart beat signals as .wav format. My work was to build a statistical model to predict heart rate from this signals. Also, I tried to develop an accurate peak detection algorithm.
